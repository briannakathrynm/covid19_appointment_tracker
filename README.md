# covid19_appointment_tracker
Project for ELE 408. COVID-19 appointment tracker and predictor for Rhode Island.

At the time of initially having this idea, it had been rather difficult for one to find a vaccination clinic that had open appointments due to the large demand of vaccinations themselves. Our goal was to create an application that obtained appointment availability data and use it to display a more concise representation of clinic availability, making it easier for users to find and make a vaccination appointment. The data would also be used in a machine learning context to predict a forecast of availability for a particular day or time.
